Training assessment for Research projects 

# ChIP-Seq Analysis 

Identify the binding sites of the DNA-associated proteins and find the overlapping binding sites between the samples.Further compare the TSS regions in the samples and conduct
pathway enrichment analysis to view the pathways which are being disrupted.


# RNA-Seq Analysis

Identify the significant genes between the treated and the untreated samples and extract the significant genes.Observe how the samples are clustered through PCA and visualize how 
samples are being clustered using heatmap. Then conduct Gene set enrichment analysis and plot the top upregulated pathways.


Produce the created report to the group leader and receive comments on the analysis pipeline.
